# Password Generator Project

## Description

For this project, I was tasked with creating a password generator that would randomly generate a password under a certain criteria chosen by the user and be within a certain length range.

## Overview

-This password generator uses prompts to let the user select how long they want their password to be, ranging from 8 to 128 characters. A few more prompts will pop up that lets the user choose if they want to use lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and/or special characters for their password.
-If the user does not select any options for what characters to use, the user will be prompted with a message saying the password will be made with lowercase characters, and will persistently keep prompting the user until they accept. 
-If the user selects a number that is outside of the range, or uses any non-number character, they will keep being prompted to enter in a suitable number before continuing.
-Once the user gets through all of the prompts, they will be brought to the password generator that will create a new, randomly generated password within the set parameters each time they click the 'generate password' button.
